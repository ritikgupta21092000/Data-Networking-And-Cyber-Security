Physical Layer
Data Link Layer --> uses MAC Address(unique among all devices) 48 bits
Network Layer --> uses IP Address 32 bits
Transport Layer (TCP / UDP)

Why do we require mac Address and IP Address in computer network ?
List any 3 points you learn from that video ?

CSMACD --> Carrier sense multiple access collision detection

Back of period

Switch

we use switch on layer 2 for Interlan communication

we use router on layer 3 which uses IP Address

IP Addresses are divided into 2 parts:
Public Addresses and Private Addresses

Private Addresses 10.0.0.0/2.255.255.555

Private Addresses are reusable Addresses

Cisco Packet Tracer is a tool which is helping network engineer to trace the packet

Mask is indicating number of bits on network side

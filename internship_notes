network --> Connection to one or more devices
or
when two or more communicating devices are connected to each other then a network is formed.
VOIP --> Voice over IP protocol
HTTP --> Hyper text transfer protocol
cluster of networks
submarine cables
intranet
internet is nothing but two or more service providers are connected to each other all over the world
VPN --> virtual private network
safe privacy
LAN ==> two or more communicating devices in a room, floor, building, campus. Cost does'nt matter.
MAN ==> two or more communicating devices connected to each other in same city. Cost does matter.
WAN ==> two or more communicating devices connected to each other within different city. Cost does matter.

OSI (Open system interconnection) reference model --> 7 layers
Physical Layer
Data Link Layer --> uses MAC Address(unique among all devices) 48 bits
Network Layer --> uses IP Address 32 bits
Transport Layer (TCP / UDP)

Why do we require mac Address and IP Address in computer network ?
List any 3 points you learn from that video ?

CSMACD --> Carrier sense multiple access collision detection

Back of period

Switch

we use switch on layer 2 for Interlan communication

we use router on layer 3 which uses IP Address

IP Addresses are divided into 2 parts:
Public Addresses and Private Addresses

Private Addresses 10.0.0.0/2.255.255.555

Private Addresses are reusable Addresses

Cisco Packet Tracer is a tool which is helping network engineer to trace the packet

Mask is indicating number of bits on network side

en
sh r
sh running-config
configure terminal
interface gigabitEthernet0/0
IP address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
no shut

show IP route
do show IP route

Four types of memory in Router:
Flash
NV(Non volatile) ram  /  Startup configuration
ram / running configuration
rom

IOS in cisco is present in Flash

To save in NV ram we use right command and it is known as Startup configuration

> user mode
# privilege mode
(config)# global configuration mode

user mode and privilege mode are knows as monitoring mode

IP Packet
Source IP address is known as sender IP Address

Routing Table

Manually defining the destination is known as static Routing

we can achieve dynamic routing with the help of routing protocols

list down various routing protocol which are used in computer network ?
List down different network devices used by cisco and juniper ?
What are the different operating systems used by cisco and juniper ?
